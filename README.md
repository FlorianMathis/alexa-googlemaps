### Step 1: Get a Google Maps API key

Each Google Maps Web Service request requires an API key or client ID. API keys
are freely available with a Google Account at
https://developers.google.com/console. The type of API key you need is a
**Server key**.

To get an API key:

 1. Visit https://developers.google.com/console and log in with
    a Google Account.
 1. Select one of your existing projects, or create a new project.
 1. Enable the API(s) you want to use. The Python Client for Google Maps Services
    accesses the following APIs:
    * Directions API
    * Distance Matrix API
    * Elevation API
    * Geocoding API
    * Geolocation API
    * Places API
    * Roads API
    * Time Zone API
 1. Create a new **Server key**.

For guided help, follow the instructions for the [Directions API][directions-key].
You only need one API key, but remember to enable all the APIs you need.
For even more information, see the guide to [API keys][apikey].

**Important:** This key should be kept secret.
